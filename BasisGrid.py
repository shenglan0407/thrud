class BasisGrid(object):
    """
    A class representing a set of rectangular grids in space -- specifically,
    x-ray scattering detectors. Does not contain all the metadata associated
    with a full-fledged Detector class (e.g. the wavelength, etc).
    Note that the geometry below is definied in "slow" and "fast" scan
    dimensions. These are simply the two dimensions that define the plane
    a single rectangular pixel grid lives in. They may also be called the y and
    x dimensions without any loss of generality.
    The convention here -- and in all of thor -- is one of Row-Major ordering,
    which is consistent with C/python. This means that y is the slow dim, x is
    the fast dim, and when ordering these two they will appear as (slow, fast).
    Note on units: units are arbitrary -- all the units must be the same for
    this to work. We don't keep track of units here.
    The class is a set of rectangular grids, with each grid defined by four
    quantities:
        -- p vector : DEFINES A GRIDS POSITION IN SPACE.
                      The vector between a chosen origin (possibly interaction
                      site) and the corner of the grid that is smallest in both
                      slow and fast (x/y) dimensions of the coordinate system.
                      Usually this will be the "bottom left" corner, but due to
                      the generality of the coordinates used, this is not
                      necessarily true.
        -- s/f vect : DEFINES A GRIDS ORIENTATION IN SPACE
                      Vectors pointing along the slow/fast-scan direction,
                      respectively. These define the plane containing the pixels.
                      The magnitudes of these vectors defines the size of the
                      pixel in that dimension.
        -- shape    : DEFINES GRID DIMENSIONS
                      The number of pixels in the fast/slow direction. Ints.
